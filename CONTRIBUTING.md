# Contributing guidelines

Make sure to follow these guidelines before opening an [issue](https://github.com/Bellisario/node-snapdrop/issues/new/choose) or a [pull request](https://github.com/Bellisario/node-snapdrop/pulls):

- An issue is for a bug or a feature request, if you have any question or something similar, please use [Discussions](https://github.com/Bellisario/node-snapdrop/discussions).
- Before opening an issue of a pull request, please check if the issue or the pull request already exists.
- Pull requests for packages updates are not allowed since there is [Dependabot]([https://github.com/hayd/deno-udd](https://github.com/Bellisario/node-snapdrop/blob/main/.github/dependabot.yml)) that checks them automatically.
- If you don't know how to contribute, also if you don't know JavaScript or Node.js, you can always help others on [Discussions](https://github.com/Bellisario/node-snapdrop/discussions), debug the application, share your awesome ideas with a new issue (feature request) and check the whole project for misspellings, too.
