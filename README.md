# node-snapdrop [![CodeQL](https://github.com/Bellisario/node-snapdrop/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Bellisario/node-snapdrop/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml)

Just the original Snapdrop, with complete Node.js server.

> [!NOTE]
> We do not endorse any recent changes made to the original Snapdrop, sold to LimeWire & [considered badware](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/27172) by uBlock Origin, so we removed all the links referring to it.\
> \
> This repository acts as a pre-LimeWire & Node.js version of the good old Snapdrop.

## Getting started

To get started, clone and cd the repo:

```

### Public Run
